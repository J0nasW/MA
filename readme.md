### Gathering #Information has never been easier

Today, SCM Data is hosted on different platforms and can be accessed via several protocols. Blockchains and Smart Contracts are disrupting this domain even more and data can now be stored encrypted on public blockchains all over the world. By adding this layer of transparency and security, the LogU Blockchain Explorer is able to stream data from public blockchains, decrypt it and display it to the user. It also offers several analysis tools to understand the data and make significant decisions quickly.

### #Interoperability is our number one priority

Currently, the LogU Blockchain Explorer works with the IOTA public blockchain (or tangle) to stream data for example from a cold chain directly into the app. The user is able to generate a wallet directly inside the application or connect his own wallet to be even more decentralized. More frameworks like Ethereum will follow in the future.
